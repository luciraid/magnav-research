Contributing to MagNav Research

- Issues: Open issues for bugs, data format questions, or research tasks.
- Pull requests: Fork, create a feature branch, implement changes, and open a PR against `master`.
- Code style: Keep notebooks and scripts documented and reproducible. Prefer small, focused commits.
- Data: Do not commit raw flight data. Add data under `data/` following `data/README.md` and reference provenance in the corresponding analysis.
- Tests: Add reproducible notebook examples where possible.
