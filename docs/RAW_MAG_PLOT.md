# Raw Magnetic Field Visualization – Flt1002

## Action
- Loaded official SGL 2020 flight data (Flt1002)
- Extracted time (`tt`) and scalar magnetometer (`mag_1_c`)
- Plotted raw magnetic field measurements

## Result
- Raw magnetic signal shows time-varying structure caused by
  aircraft motion and onboard magnetic interference

## Output
- figures/Flt1002_raw_scalar_mag.png

## Notes
This visualization provides intuition for the interference patterns
that Tolles–Lawson compensation is designed to remove.
