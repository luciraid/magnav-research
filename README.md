# MagNav Research Repository

Purpose
- This repository contains original analysis, documentation, and research artifacts derived from the MagNav project. It will host ongoing research work, experiments, and notes.

Relationship to original MagNav
- The original reference repository `MagNav` remains unchanged and authoritative for production code. This repository intentionally contains only original analysis and documentation derived from that work.

Current status
- Repository initialized and analysis artifacts migrated into `docs/` and `logs/`.
- Awaiting external flight data to continue experiments.

Notes
- Source code from the original `MagNav` repository was not copied. Only analysis documents and logs were migrated.
